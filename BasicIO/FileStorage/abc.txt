This is test2 of my write function functionality
I like how it seems to be working with multiple lines

OOOOh even this works! Now how do I trigger it to stop? Maybe just have getline read it and then exit if its the appropriate line? ///

This is a test of the QuickThought feature, that allows you to rapidly write down a thought and avoid writing out a full command or know where exactly to put the idea until after you've written it 
This is perfect for someone, like me, who struggles to get their ideas down on paper fast enough. This will hopefully be of use

test 3
