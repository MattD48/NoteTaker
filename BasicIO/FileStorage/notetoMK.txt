Hello Melissa! 
Thank you for the wrap up meeting this afternoon, you answered a lot of questions about the summer wrap up and especially the return offer ordeal. I did feel that my specific scenario may not have been as applicable for all on the meeting, so I decided to reach out privately. 

Currently I am a Test Engineering intern, but I had the opportunity to chat with Robert Griffith on the Digital Design team. It looks like he has requested me as an intern for next summer in the Digital Design department and has also sent my information through HR (my contact has been Kristen Tatro). I was able to chat with Kristen recently and she said that the process was underway, and with what you presented today, it sounds like it September is when I should expect to hear back. 

In an effort to be prepared for the future, what does the current internship outlook for next year look like? Will returning interns have a priority and do you anticipate Qorvo lowering the number of interns? With how the career field is looking for college students, I am trying to be as prepared as I can be. 

Will this transfer from test to design present any significant challenges, and if so, what can I do to help?
