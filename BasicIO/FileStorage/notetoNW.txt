Hey Nathan!

Hopefully this email gets sent after I leave. 
Thank you so much for guiding me this summer and giving me a truly valuable and memorable experience. I feel like throughout all this, I've grown as a student, engineer, and person. I feel more technically and mentally capable going back to school, and I believe that is a result of what you taught me and the experiences you provided me with. 
A particular moment that I will cherish from this summer was staying until 6:40 to work on the oscilloscope code library. In those extra hours, I learned a lot about programming, but mostly about problem solving. It was the first time in my career that I felt like I wasn't stressed about time, but focused solely on the end product. I believe that experience has influenced my understanding on what engineering really is about. I have a better view of engineering as a career because of that experience and look forward to another late night, programming error hunt in the future!
Thank you for all the memories and lessons! I hope to see you next summer or sometime this fall or spring in Raleigh!
